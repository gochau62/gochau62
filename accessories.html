      <h2>The Role of Accessories in Clothing</h2>
        <p> Accessories have a major impact in clothing and making outfits, they can provide
            to the overall look and can change the current outfit based on the occasion. For example
            wearing a diamond studded custom chain may show wealth however, a classic minimalistic chain may just 
            change and perceive that perfect look for a dinner night. Accessories allow you to express yourself
            and your personality, by choosing what to wear and how to combine them with an outfit they can 
            really make your look pop out more vividly.

        <h2>Usage of Accessories in Outfits</h2>
        <p> An artist known by the artist name <a class="underline" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Boogie_wit_da_Hoodie" target="_blank">A Boogie wit da Hoodie</a>
            had recently performed at the University of New Hampshire. He has multiple top hits and is easily my [author's] top artist of the year for the last couple of years.
            He has been in hundreds of performances but a friend had and I had gotten the chance to witness this when he had captured a picture similar to this.
            His outfit in this picture is full of designer clothing however is combined with a unique set of shoes. He is wearing steel toe work boots? You may be wondering why?
            However, this is in the trend and fits the aesthetic of his outfit. He flaunt a fulled studded diamond chain that boasts his wealth while on stage, and can be seen 
            wearing multiple clothing apparels of <a class="underline" href="https://www.chromehearts.com/" target="_blank">Chrome Hearts</a> 
            which is a wickedly expensive. Each piece retails around 10s of thousands of dollars, really showing how expensive his outfit is.
            At the normal eye it is a casual outfit and would be unsuspecting to the normal viewer but those who follow urban culture as well as 
            social media understand the wealth of his outfit. The fact he is wearing boots shows that he likes to keep his fit clean and would rather not
            crease or destroy a nice pair of shoes that may be uncomfortable to perform in. </p>

        <h2>Jewelry, Belts, Watches, and Other Accessories </h2>
        <p> Here another hip-hop artist, <a class="underline" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lil_Baby" target="_blank">Lil Baby</a>
            shows off his diamond studded watches, chains, and earings. All pieces are well worths over 20k and he can be seen going to 
            the diamond shop <a class="underline" href="https://www.icebox.com/" target="_blank">Icebox</a>
            frequently to diverse himself in a wide asset of accessories. Another important accessory that has not been 
            mentioned is the belt. Which brings about a lot of a persons expression and style, as some are elegant,
            fancy, or flashy. This can also be said about the watch which also has the same variables that can be read from a person.
            Each individual accessory is custom fit and tailored to the person not only physically but also spiritually as it can tell
            a lot about the person. In this case a wide variety of jewelry, belts, and watches if affordable would be best as different styles
            are more prominent in different environment and conditions.
