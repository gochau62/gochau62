        <h3>Defining Streetwear</h3>
        <p> Streetwear is defined as a simple style of clothing that is fashionable and includes influences 
            of urban culture which reside within a subculture group such as skaters and new york "drillers".
            It is not only confined to these groups but a wide and diverse group of individuals that come
            together to shape and influence the urban youth subgroups. Streetwear can also be defined as the
            production, promotion, and resale of casual fashion making the retail prices high and stock low 
            which makes finding shoes and shirts of designer streetwear that much harder. These brands often
            try to target younger urban audiences such as those under 25 years old as many of the pieces are
            shown to have a stronger influence in teens to mid adults who want casual fashion but with a limited
            price tag and value to them.</p>
