        or even out in public with crazy styles. The same can be said for sports players, you can see many show up with flashy styles,
        sleek and minimalistic designs and casual clothing. Each persons style is unique however it is up to the viewer to perceive what
        they see. If you have a strong liking towards a favorite sports team, or genre of music or enjoy a certain activity it bases you 
        outfits and clothing of choice. However in the influencers at the top of each category and hobby depict what is being worn. Most of
