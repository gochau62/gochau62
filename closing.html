      <h2>History of Streetwear and Designer Clothing</h2>
        <p> Streetwear in the last couple years has become a growing trend and has become a mainstream
            icon however, that was not always the case. Origins of Streetwear came from skaters in the late 1970s
            and weren't popularized until recent years. This is the same case for designer clothes as many of the brands
            date back over 200 years before World War II. In the 1980s, surfing and skateboarding were the two most popular
            cultures. People also began producing custom skateboards, surfboards, as well as t-shirts to express personality
            as well show different types of style of surfing and skating. Magazines began sharing the widespread of skating as well
            as surfing which led to the ultimate rise of streetwear culture. Designer clothing brands such as Gucci and Louis Vuitton
            both started out as small lugging and leather companies. They primarily focused on suitcases, and bags. In 2013 they partnered
            with <a class="underline" href="https://www.dior.com/en_us?utm_source=Rakuten&utm_medium=affiliates&utm_content=PPkX79_c.b0-6.Xep8o.bksyJSUntkaSZA&ranMID=43935&ranEAID=PPkX79%2Fc*b0&ranSiteID=PPkX79_c.b0-6.Xep8o.bksyJSUntkaSZA" target="_blank">Dior</a> 
            and started producing accessories which became a wildfire as many consumers hurried to purchase jackets, and other apparel. 
            Their eventual growth from a bag company to a widespread clothing brand was transformed because of major partnership
            between Louis Vuitton and Dior.

        <h2>A New World for Fashion Design</h2>
        <p> The model is depicted wearing Dior x Air Jordan collaboration clothing which retails at an insane value, these kinds of designer x streetwear collaborations are
            high in demand, and are valued at a crazy amount. The history of clothes which expanded just from making leather bags as well as a small clothing brand 
            based off of skaters and surfboarding shows how the community of fashion comes together and works to create the community we have today.
            Celebrities, musicians, athletes, all play a crucial role in marketing for clothing, their influence while wearing different styles, brands, and 
            accessories influences the urban culture and created a community who strives to create unique styles and different blends of flavor with fashion.

        <h3>Summary: Evolution of Clothing </h3>
        <p> Wrapping up this website, the tremendous amount of information that was put into this was from a wide variety of resources
            The influence of fashion, streetwear, designer clothing, urban and pop culture has a major influence on my personal likings.
            It is everywhere in the world and is unique, exciting and always evolving. The culture of fashion is forever growing, there is 
            no limit to style and the types of clothing that there are today. Streetwear is a trend and will be ever changing as the community 
            grows apart from old trends and clothing that is no longer relevant or appear in the culture. Many brands will stick and last around
            for centuries and that is the exciting part of clothing culture. As a society personality, style, culture, environment, and many other
            things can be said about a persons clothing and their apparel of choice. However, you should never take into an account someones
            social status, well-being and person as a being based on the clothes they choose to wear. Everyone is allowed their own opinion, choice
            of clothes and ultimately at the end of the day they get to choose what they want to wear. Do not judge someone based off of their appearance,
            or whether or not their style does not match the same as yours. Clothes can be evolved from a style to traditional clothes worn for
            cultural appropriation and have many meanings behind them, and are carefully curated and made to fit the cultures traditions. Clothing
            is ever evolving and although many brands have not risen to the top yet they just have not had the opportunity of exposure.
            If you ever decide to research designer clothing, streetwear, or fashion design know that marketing is they key.
