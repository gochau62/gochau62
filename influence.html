      <h2>What Makes Streetwear and Designer Clothing Stand Out?</h2>
        <p> 
        A reason as to why Streetwear is so popular and stands out is because of urban culture, or
        pop culture today. Social media and other influences make it so that when you have a piece of clothing
        of value or high demand it can be easily be recognizable whether it is with a branding, letter, or name.
        Even logos are easily noticeable or small amounts of script. Designer clothes are made of high quality material
        silk, chiffon, lace, satin and others. The price tag is also a major factor with pieces of simple classic clothing
        trending upwards of hundreds of dollars. Sizes are in high demands, as pieces are always being resold, however
        designer clothes are usually tailored perfectly to your size and can make it look perfect around your body. 
        They are hemmed and stitched in a specific way to wrap around you. They also often include a unique looked whether
        it is a show stopping design or a blast of color or a popular design it always will make you stand out in a certain way.

        <h2>Who is making designer and streetwear popular?</h2>
        <p> Today everyone is making designer and streetwear popular, however the major audience is 
            influencers and celebrities. Many of those who are influencing urban an pop culture have 
            started to make their own clothing brands and are highly successful due to the amount of followers
            and their fan base that they have. It is much easier to promote your clothing if you already have 
            a large following however, many people can still model and influence their own pieces of clothing, using
            social media which makes it so powerful as everyone can do it.
