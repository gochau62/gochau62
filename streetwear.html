      <h2>How is Designer Streetwear Made?</h2>
        <p> Making and designing streetwear is abstract, there is no real answer on how to make any
            piece of clothing and it can be up to your ideas and beliefs on how to create it. However,
            there is a trend that many artist follow. Many of the pieces are trendy and follow urban
            culture. If you enjoy surfing or music you would probably want a piece of clothing that 
            would resemble your interests. Despite this, the main trend that artists follow is popularity
            and exposure. They try and get many popular celebrities and influences to wear clothing to
            increase the amount of people that view their work. Typically when your favorite musician or
            movie star is wearing a certain piece of clothing or style many people who look up to these 
            individuals will more than likely purchase these pieces. Many designer streetwear pieces are 
            made in certain ways such as being cutoff to show belts, and are usually made of premium materials
            along with casual fashion and luxury items, The history behind the clothing has much more meaning 
            behind the actual manufacturing of these casual pieces of clothing because anybody can create a 
            piece of clothing with premium materials. The influence of celebrities and those who embrace the 
            clothing are those that really attract and bring the revenue and kickstart brands.

        <h2>How has streetwear impacted fashion?</h2>
        <p> Streetwear has been around for a long time however, many were considered the original founders of streetwear
            for example <a class="underline" href="https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/shawn-stussy-biography/" target="_blank">Shawn Stussy</a>
            founder of <a class="underline" href="https://www.stussy.com/" target="_blank">Stussy</a> brand laid the foundation 
            for many styles of streetwear and started a generation of clothing before it was even considered.
            Today many of his styles are still represented in clothing and his influence on the structure
            of clothing created a strong foundation for the future. We can see artists such as Drake, Travis Scott
            and other notable rappers start their own clothing brands with their own branding and merchandise for
            sale using similar styles to Stussy with their own twist. However their popularity has allowed for their
            brand to grow at a tremendously large rate.
